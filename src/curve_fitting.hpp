/** \file curve_fitting.hpp
 * \brief Curve fitting functionality
 */

/** \brief Generates coefficients for an polynomial to map
 * `measured_coefficients` to `expected_coordinates` via regression
 *
 * Produces coefficients for a function
 * `coefficients[0]*x^0 + ... + coefficients[i]*x^i + ... + `
 * `coefficients[NCoefficients-1]*x^(NCoefficients-1)`.
 * Used to linearize Hall-Effect sensor output.
 *
 * \note Increasing `NCoefficients` will affect runtime of `fit_curve`, but it
 * is a once-per-calibration operation. However, increasing `NCoefficients` will
 * increase runtime of sensor linearization which is run on every poll, so there
 * is a tradeoff between accuracy and performance.
 *
 * \tparam NCoordinates Number of measured/expected coordinates
 * \tparam NCoefficients Number of coefficients to generate
 * \param coefficients Output array for coefficients
 * \param measured_coordinates The measured input coordinates
 * \param expected_coordinates The expected output coordinates
